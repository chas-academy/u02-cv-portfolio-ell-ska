### note: i'm using container queries and they don't pass the css validator

this is a pretty new feature but it has decent [support](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries), i don't think the validator has been updated for a while as it just says this feature doesn't exist. i've implemented this as a progressive enhancement, meaning the site will be fully responsive even if the user has an old browser. Olli-Heikki says this was fine as long as i explained how it works. i just wanted to learn something new :)
